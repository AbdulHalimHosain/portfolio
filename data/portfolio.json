  "aboutpara": "My name is Abdul Halim Hosain. I graduated from BRAC University with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I earned a CGPA of 3.77 out of 4.00. I have always loved technology and this led me to develop a strong interest in web development. Because of this interest, I became skilled in languages and tools like PHP, Laravel, React, JavaScript, Next.js, NestJS, MySQL, and Git.\nI worked on many projects such as job portals, doctor appointment systems, and inventory systems. I also did an internship as a Software Engineer where I learned to build strong web applications and make them faster. I am skilled at both front-end and back-end development.\n\nI am a quick learner and enjoy solving problems. I love challenges and always try to improve myself. I have received merit-based scholarships for my academic achievements and have been on the VCâ€™s List and Deanâ€™s List several times. I want to keep growing in the web development field and learn new things. I am very passionate about this sector.",
